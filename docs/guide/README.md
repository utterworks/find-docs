### Enabling new style of search
Find is designed to take your search to the next level. Keyword search is effective and appropriate for many situations, but Machine Learning has enabled systems to search based on word meaning rather than string matching. As new language processing models are developed, new styles of search are also possible. Based on our research and collaboration, we bring the best AI has to offer in Natural Language processing and apply it to Search.
