# Index and Deploy

## Start an Indexing Job

### Monitor Job Progress
Clicking on the Index Version Id takes you through to the details page for the Index job. While the job is running the job status is updated as urls are processed by the indexer. The  
status shows the number of urls processed in total and a count of those that have been successfully processed and a count of any that have failed to process.

Once the Index job is complete the status is updated to reflect this with the final counts of urls indexed. There are also links that become active to allow the download of the list of the urls indexed for reference, and to download the actual extracted content.
