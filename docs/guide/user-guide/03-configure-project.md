# Configure a project
In the projects view, clicking on the project name takes you to the project configuration.
## Index Configuration
The first step to setting up a new project is to configure the source of the content to be included in the search app - we call this the index. The index configuration is a view on the left hand project navigation view, or if the project is new and hasn't yet had an index configured there is a configure index button top right
